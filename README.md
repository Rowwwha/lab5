This project holds simple, modern styles (CSS) for all the common parts of a website like buttons, cards, and forms. It makes sure everything looks good on any screen size, whether it's a phone or a computer. To use these styles, you need to copy this project (clone it) and connect the main style file to your HTML. Then, you can apply the styles using short names like .btn or .card. You can easily change the main colors and look of the whole theme by editing the color codes found in the CSS variables (like --primary).
